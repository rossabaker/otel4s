# otel4s

otel4s is an experimental [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
client for Scala built on [Cats
Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).  It is a thin
abstraction, with an implementation backed by
[opentelemetry-java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/api/all).

As of May 10, 2022, only the Metrics API is covered, and only
partially.  No artifacts are published yet.
